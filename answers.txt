Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Git facilitates the development process by allowing developers to
commit snapshots of their project and make changes to the existing files and
code without breaking things. This may be useful for the group project where
multiple people are working on the same project, but may want to create
branches to develop code without breaking the existing code. It also helps you
keep track of the different versions of the project as you work.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it
might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to the sports industry. There exists
substantial data about different players, teams, etc. and analysts are
interested in analyzing the data to draw insights. They may want to analyze
the data to make predictions on the success of players or teams or to
determine whether rules need to be changed to improve safety.

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging creates a new commit with all of the changes of one branch,
combined with the current branch. Rebasing takes all the changes of the
mainline and moves them into the feature branch, so that your feature branch
will be the most recent commit.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to improve my knowledge of Git because it was important to
understand for my most recent internship where I was making changes to the
existing code. I also would like to get better with SQL so that I can easily
query databases to draw interesting insights.
