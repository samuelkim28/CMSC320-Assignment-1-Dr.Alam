Q1: Why might we consider using git?

Answer: Git facilitates the development process by allowing developers to
commit snapshots of their project and make changes to the existing files and
code without breaking things. This may be useful for the group project where
multiple people are working on the same project, but may want to create
branches to develop code without breaking the existing code. It also helps you
keep track of the different versions of the project as you work.

substantial data about different players, teams, etc. and analysts are
